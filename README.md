ðŸ’¡ Struggling to revise core MERN concepts before interviews?  
Or want to refresh your fundamentals in a structured, fast-paced way?  

Iâ€™m conducting **Web Development Refresher Sessions** â€“ a marathon-style 4-hour class where we revise the **entire MERN stack in Hybrid mode**:

âœ… JavaScript (Core + Advanced: closures, async, promises, OOP)  
âœ… React.js (Hooks, Router, State management)  
âœ… Node.js (modules, event-driven, APIs)  
âœ… Express.js (REST APIs, middleware, authentication)  
âœ… MongoDB (CRUD, schema design, Mongoose)  

ðŸ‘‰ Designed for students, freshers & working professionals preparing for **interviews, hackathons, and real-world projects**.  

ðŸŽ¯ Format: Hands-on coding + practical explanations + interview Q&A  
ðŸ“Œ Duration: 3 -4 hours per session
ðŸ“Œ Mode: Live, online  

If you want to **refresh concepts in minimum time with maximum clarity**, this is for you.
